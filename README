# README for Temperature and Humidity Monitoring Script

> Certainly! Below is the README file for the code you've provided. This code captures temperature and humidity data from a Raspberry Pi's Sense HAT and sends the data to an MQTT broker.
>
> ### Introduction
>
> This Python script leverages the Paho MQTT library to publish temperature and humidity data gathered from a Sense HAT on a Raspberry Pi to an MQTT broker. The data includes timestamps, temperature readings, humidity readings, and various IDs related to the sensors.
>
> ### Dependencies
>
> - **Paho MQTT Client**: A library to provide a client class which enables applications to connect to an MQTT broker to publish messages and to subscribe to topics and receive published messages.
> - **Sense HAT Library**: A library to interact with the Raspberry Pi Sense HAT, used to capture environmental data like temperature and humidity.
>
> ### Installation
>
> Make sure you have the following packages installed:
>
> ```bash
> pip install paho-mqtt
> pip install sense-hat
> ```
>
> ### Configuration
>
> In the script, you need to configure:
>
> - `broker_ip`: The IP address of the MQTT broker you are connecting to.
> - `broker_port`: The port of the MQTT broker (usually 1883 for non-TLS communication).
> - Credentials (username and password) if the MQTT broker requires authentication.
>
> ### How to Run
>
> Simply execute the Python script to start capturing sensor data and publishing it to the specified MQTT topic.
>
> ```bash
> python your_script_name.py
> ```
>
> ### Output
>
> The script will keep running, printing the sensor data to the console, and publishing the data to the `iot/data` topic on the MQTT broker every 5 seconds.
>
> ### Notes
>
> - This script assumes that the Sense HAT is equipped with both temperature and humidity sensors.
> - Ensure that the MQTT broker specified by `broker_ip` is running and accessible from the device executing the script.
> - The keys like 'batchNo', 'warehouseNo', etc., in the `get_sensor_data` function are currently hardcoded as string literals. You may want to replace them with actual values or dynamically assign them as needed for your specific use case.
